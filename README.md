# Capstone

The use case for my app is myself. I like to take road trips, I tend to travel by myself, and I want to make sure that I'm not missing exciting, random, strange, and different places on the road.

My app maps out your current road trip plan, upcoming points of interest, and allows you to add one of those destinations to your drive, and check in when you get there.
